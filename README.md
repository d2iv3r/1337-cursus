## The 42 Scholar System

The 42 Scholar System is a peer-driven and gamified learning approach that emphasizes:

- **Self-paced Learning:** Students progress at their own pace, ensuring mastery of each concept before moving on.
- **Peer Learning:** Collaboration and knowledge-sharing among peers replace traditional lectures.
- **Project-based Curriculum:** Hands-on projects simulate real-world challenges to build technical and problem-solving skills.
- **Gamification:** Students earn experience points (XP) and climb a rank ladder by completing projects, encouraging healthy competition and self-motivation.
- **Evaluation and Defense:** Code reviews and project defenses by peers enhance communication skills and ensure high standards of work.

This unique system fosters independence, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit, preparing students for dynamic and fast-paced professional environments.
